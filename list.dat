Actually, I think my fear of yams began in my early youth, when many of my young comrades pelted me with same for singing songs of far-off lands and deep blue seas in a language closely resembling that of the common sow. My psychosis was further impressed into my soul as I reached adolescence, when, while skipping through a field of yams, light-heartedly tossing flowers into the stratosphere, a great yam-picking machine tore through the fields, pursuing me to the edge of the great plantation, where I escaped by diving into a great ditch filled with a mixture of water and pig manure, which may explain my tendency to scream, "Here come the Martians!  Hide the eggs!" every time I have pork.  But I digress.  The fact remains that I cannot rationally deal with yams, and pigs are terrible conversationalists.

But the Times might have enough room on the jump page to include a line or so that says something like: "When he finished his speech, Muskie burst into tears and seized his campaign manager by the side of the neck.

The guy on the left has an Uzi submachine gun concealed in his attache case.  Also in the case are four fully loaded, 32-round clips of 125-grain 9mm ammunition.  The owner of the Uzi is going to get more tactical firepower delivered -- and delivered on target -- in less time, and with less effort.  All for $795. It's inevitable. If you're going up against some guy with an Osborne 1 -- or any personal computer -- he's the one who's in trouble.  One round from an Uzi can zip through ten inches of solid pine wood, so you can imagine what it will do to structural foam acrylic and sheet aluminum.  In fact, detachable magazines for the Uzi are available in 25-, 32-, and 40-round capacities, so you can take out an entire office full of Apple II or IBM Personal Computers tied into Ethernet or other local-area networks.  What about the new 16-bit computers, like the Lisa and Fortune?  Even with the Winchester backup, they're no match for the Uzi.  One quick burst and they'll find out what Unix means.

foo_178,Lemma:  All horses are the same color. Proof (by induction): 	Case n = 1: In a set with only one horse, it is obvious that all 	horses in that set are the same color. 	Case n = k: Suppose you have a set of k+1 horses.  Pull one of these 	horses out of the set, so that you have k horses.  Suppose that all 	of these horses are the same color.  Now put back the horse that you 	took out, and pull out a different one.  Suppose that all of the k 	horses now in the set are the same color.  Then the set of k+1 horses 	are all the same color.  We have k true => k+1 true; therefore all 	horses are the same color. Theorem: All horses have an infinite number of legs. Proof (by intimidation): 	Everyone would agree that all horses have an even number of legs.  It 	is also well-known that horses have forelegs in front and two legs in 	back.  4 + 2 = 6 legs, which is certainly an odd number of legs for a 	horse to have!  Now the only number that is both even and odd is 	infinity; therefore all horses have an infinite number of legs. 	However, suppose that there is a horse somewhere that does not have an 	infinite number of legs.  Well, that would be a horse of a different 	color; and by the Lemma, it doesn't exist.

Yet around his neck was a chain bearing the bronze octagon that marked him as an alumnus of Unseen University, the high school of magic whose time-and-space transcendent campus is never precisely Here or There. Graduates were usually destined for mageship at least, but Rincewind--after an unfortunate event--had left knowing only one spell and made a living of sorts around the town by capitalizing on an innate gift for languages.

baz_232,If I had my life to live over, I'd try to make more mistakes next time.  I would relax, I would limber up, I would be sillier than I have been this trip.  I know of very few things I would take seriously.  I would be crazier. I would climb more mountains, swim more rivers and watch more sunsets.  I'd travel and see.  I would have more actual troubles and fewer imaginary ones. You see, I am one of those people who lives prophylactically and sensibly and sanely, hour after hour, day after day.

Just moments, one after another, instead of living so many years ahead each day.  I have been one of those people who never go anywhere without a thermometer, a hotwater bottle, a gargle, a raincoat and a parachute. If I had it to do over again, I would go places and do things and travel lighter than I have.  If I had my life to live over, I would start bare-footed earlier in the spring and stay that way later in the fall.  I would play hooky more.  I probably wouldn't make such good grades, but I'd learn more.  I would ride on more merry-go-rounds.  I'd pick more daisies.
